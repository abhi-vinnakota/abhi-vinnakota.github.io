                    Hi! I'm a freshman studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (<a href = "https://cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC</a>). I'm passionate about Web Dev and FinTech. I love building websites in my free time and enjoy reading about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and other emerging technologies. I'm currently a Software Developer for the Quantitative Finance (<a href = "https://uiucquant.web.illinois.edu/">Quant</a>) Club at my school, where I'm working on our quantitative trading platform.
