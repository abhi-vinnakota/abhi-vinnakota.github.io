# Personal Website

## Overview
The purpose of my website is to act as a resume and to showcase my projects. This is the first project I've built with ReactJS, and I really enjoyed learning React. It's a super cool language, and I definitely will use it for my Web dev projects from here on out. I got a taste of what React can do, but I think I could do even more with it in the future. Overall, I wanted my website to be pretty minimalistic. Color choice was pretty important to me and I spent some time looking at other websites for inspiration. Shout out to Brittany Chiang, because I used her color palette as inspiration for the one I used. I wanted to use React components and animations wherever possible, and found some cool libraries to integrate into my project. 

## Technologies Used
Completely ReactJS and CSS. I was debating whether to use React styled-components or not, but I decided against it for this project. 

## Future Plans
I will definitely keep updating my website with new experiences and projects. I'm also thinking about adding more animations, and making the Navbar look better. I will do those in the near future since there are other projects I want to focus on right now.
